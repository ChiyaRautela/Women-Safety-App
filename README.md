The Women's Connect application is a mobile solution designed to address safety concerns 
faced by women, offering features such as SOS alerts, location sharing, self-defense tips, 
emergency contact messaging, and customizable settings. With a simple shake or button 
press, users can trigger SOS alerts that notify pre-defined contacts of their location and 
situation, providing a discreet way to seek help. Real-time location sharing enables users to 
keep trusted contacts informed of their whereabouts, promoting accountability and personal 
safety during travel or late-night commutes. The app also provides access to self-defense 
techniques and safety tips, empowering women with knowledge to protect themselves in 
various situations. Additionally, users can send pre-configured emergency messages to 
designated contacts and customize settings according to their preferences. By combining 
advanced technology with user-friendly interfaces, the Women's Connect app aims to create a 
supportive platform for women to proactively manage their safety and well-being in diverse 
environments
